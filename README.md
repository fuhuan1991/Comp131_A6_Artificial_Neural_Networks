GARDENS OF HEAVEN

A gardener of the Gardens of Heaven is given the task to straighten up a mess that has happened the day before. A prankster (no one knows if a customer or an employee) mixed up all the Iris plants in the nursery and removed all the tags from the pots. There were three benches in the greenhouse. **On each bench, a type of Iris: Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolour, and Iris Virginica.**

Your job is to help the gardener to classify all the pots with the help of a multi-layer neural network. Your program will have two functionalities: train the ANN, and classify the plants based on user input. During classification, the gardener will be asked to provide all the necessary information and respond with a predicted class of Iris.

To train the ANN, you will use the Fisherâ€™s Iris database (Fisher, 1936). This database is perhaps the best-known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of Iris plant. One class is linearly separable from the other two; the latter are not linearly separable from each other.

The data base contains the following attributes:

- Sepal length in cm
- Sepal width in cm
- Petal length in cm
- Petal width in cm

Class:
- **Iris Setosa**
- **Iris Versicolour**
- **Iris Virginica**

The database is available in trunk in the Problem Set 4 assignment page. It must be loaded by your ANN for training and validation purposes. The testing portion of the dataset should be used manually to simulate the gardener input.
